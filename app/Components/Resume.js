				  <strong>January 2014 - present: </strong><br />
				  <div className='underline'></div>

				  As an urgent care facility, Stat Health is a fast-paced environment requiring multitasking while maintaining strict adherence to protocol. This job integrated my past experience in clinical medicine with general office and minor management skills. I trained several other employees in this position.

				  <br /><br />

				Intake/discharge duties included verifying patient insurance, processing deductibles/copays and submitting insurance claims using medical software. I also handled office inventory and worked with the IT department to resolve any software and hardware issues that arose- usually involving printers.
				
				<br /><br />

				Working at this job gave me insight into the structure and functionality of various types of software used in healthcare, as well as the pros and cons of each. Analyzing what kind of UI/UX was most intuitive and why is what initially sparked my interest in learning to develop applications myself.
