		  Over the course of learning new JavaScript features and patterns,
		  I often found myself jotting down various miscellaneous notes scattered
		  across notebooks. I wanted a way to organize these notes based on the 
		  specifics of what they pertained to- whether that was the DOM, the React
		  framework, ES6 features, etc, and then be able to easily look them up again
		  later. This project is a working demo of my solution to this problem. <a target='blank' href='https://corvid-redux.firebaseapp.com'>
		  See it here.</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  This application utilizes React and Redux to organize and
		  store posts on various topics. Each post can be tagged
		  with relevant keywords so that it can easily be searched later.
		</p>
		
		<img className='screenshot' src={ require( '../Images/corvid1.png' ) } />
		
		<p>
		  The deployed application demo mocks a database by simulating
		  an Ajax call to load the initial posts into the sidebar. These topics
		  are stored in the Redux store, from which the application will have 
		  access to each topic's content and searchable tags/keywords.
		</p>
		
		<img className='screenshot' src={ require( '../Images/corvid2.png' ) } />
		
		<p>
		  The slideover search feature allows the user to search the posts currently
		  in the Redux store by matching their keywords. Posts added via the add post 
		  option (on the bottom of the sidebar) will also appear in these search results
		  when their keywords are searched. 
		</p>
		
		<img className='screenshot' src={ require( '../Images/corvid3.png' ) } />
		
		<img className='screenshot' src={ require( '../Images/corvid4.png' ) } />
		
		<h2>Pending features:</h2>
		
		<p>
		  Future functionality to be added to this application includes
		  the ability to edit pre-existing posts, as well as remove them.
		  I intend to eventually refactor this application to be an
		  Electron desktop application.
